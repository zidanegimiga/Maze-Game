# Maze-Game

In this project, I learn how to use ray casting and how it is used to render a 3D world in a 2D map.
The Library used is SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) which is a cross-platform development library written in C.
It is designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. 
Some notable projects designed with SDL that i love include:
 - DCS: Black Shark
 - Brutal Legend
 - Divinity: Original Sin
 - Half-life

# Game Features:
The player can use the direction keyboard keys to navigate the maze.
