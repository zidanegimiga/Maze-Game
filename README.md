# Maze-Game

In this project, I learn how to use ray casting and how it is used to render a 3D world in a 2D map.
The Library used is SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) which is a cross-platform development library written in C.
It is designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. 
Some notable projects designed with SDL that i love include:
 - DCS: Black Shark
 - Brutal Legend
 - Divinity: Original Sin
 - Half-life

# Game Features:
The player can use the direction keyboard keys to navigate the maze.

# Coding Style
For a while now, i have been using the Betty Style to code all of my C-related projects. But as a change, i would like to start following the 
[Linux Kernel writing style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html). This is largely due to the my interest in contributing 
to kernel open source. I have to start getting my mind used to the coding style. Overall, I find the Linux style much easier especially when maintaining a 
large repository. Everything seems easier to see when you have been looking at your screen for long hours.

# Installation
Star the git repository and wait for the damn project to be complete
